It is said in old fairy tale, 年 is the name of a monster. He will came out on this time of year and eat people. And we will fight them in a way of firecrackers, to scare him off. Greet each other on the first day of new year, as a congratulation to each other that we are not eaten by 年.

Gradually, greeting each other on the first day of year became 拜年 and this saying can be used for a long while around new year. For example, Chinese say 拜早年, means it is a little bit early, but still, greetings!

On the first few days of new year (no clear boundary, maybe 4 or 5 days), it is 拜年 And later than that, it became 拜晚年. 年兽 as full name.

In the night before new year, most Chinese people will watch the Evening Party of the Spring Festival ([春节联欢晚会](http://chunwan.cntv.cn/)) by CCTV. It's a tradition that all family members gather together , have diner and watch 春节联欢晚会.
