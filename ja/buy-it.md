- Internet
- Water
- Transportation card
- Mattress at the entrance of your home.
- ChinaMobile phone sometimes cannot be used in Japan. ChinaUnicom is WCDMA so can be used.
- Internet plan offers 10Mbps (1500 yuan / year) or 100Mbps (3500 yuan / year)
- Electronics products of Japan are wonderful. The great quality. "If you want to keep the quality of life in Japan", everything must be pricey in Shanghai.
