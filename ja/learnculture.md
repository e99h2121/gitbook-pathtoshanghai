## Learn Culture

When we moved to overseas, we should acquire the ["Four Stages of Living Abroad"](http://twenty-somethingtravel.com/2010/10/stages-living/). The stage below is my understanding, and own experience.

- Honeymoon Stage

Everything is interesting, and exciting. Many hope. Something like just a tourist. But be careful, it is just a beginning of your new life. We need to keep our pace.

- Frustration or Rage Stage

Feel some unconfortableness. Sometimes make complaint with other, including your home country. With saying "Why you don't understand!".. But we need to accept. Because they are not able to know what you are feeling.

- Understanding Stage

After experience many frustration, finally understand how can we accept any difficulty.

- Acclimation Stage

Really get used to the environment, and can enjoy.

We need to understand there must be these stage, and anyone may need to experience because there is difference between your home country and China. To avoid whole frustration is hard, but by understanding it, we can ease.
