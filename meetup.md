##### Date, Place 2014.04.20 @Dianping 安化路Office

Here is several link that you can study at first:

- https://www.docker.io/community/ 
- https://github.com/dotcloud/docker

And you can find several [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/search/slideshow?searchfrom=header&q=Docker).
Particularly impressive point for me was below since we had been bothered these kind of 'hell'.

- p.14 This eliminated the NxN problem...
- [p.18 Docker solves the NxN problem...](http://www.slideshare.net/dotCloud/why-docker?qid=74992213-fe99-4a21-993d-421c16de4aa4&v=qf1&b=&from_search=1)



By these we can eliminate vendor lock-in.
Weak point is :

- Its Docker project itself seems still under development phase. 
- We need to try by our module. To install our service on the Docker.
- Not only this 'Docker', we can find several kind of Environment-level containers. We should compare it.

In second half of session, presenter had mentioned about qiniu([七牛](http://www.qiniu.com/)). 为移动时代开发者打造的数据平台. Create a data platform for mobile developers Times
